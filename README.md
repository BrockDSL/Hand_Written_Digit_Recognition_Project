# Python TensorFlow ANN


### Description
This project will go over the creation and usage of a TensorFlow neural network in the application of data validation for large data sets. Artifical neural networks are loosely inspired by biological nerual netowrks that constitute the brain of an animal. Artifical neural netowrks learn by example, given a set of data with proper formatting, field types and correctness. We should be able to get our ANN to learn how to validate more data based on these qualities. In large scale applications where it would be impossible to manually verify data's "correctness" due to it's size, an ANN can be used.

### Tools used.
For this project I will be using [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/), [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
